# betterRofi
A suit of different rofi based tools made to increase efficency

Hi that's my first real project as well!

Juste a little instruction about the instalation:
- you can copy the files everywhere on your Linux device
- compile all the .cpp files using $```g++ *.cpp```
- and finaly move the .betterRofi folder to your .config file

The theme is one of the themes that are available on the repo :

https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi

which also inspired me to do this project.
